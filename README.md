# Oiza's website (V 2.0)

### Process 
I began to revise my website in early January 2020, with the following goals:
- start with grayscale (black and white) and only add color afterwards
- implement lessons learned from the course [Better Web Typography](https://betterwebtype.com/)
- to design and build mobile first.

It took about a week to complete, and I'm quite thrilled with the results!
